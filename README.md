# RPG

An RPG game powered by React.

## Installation Instructions

### After cloning down:

- Run yarn install in both the root AND client dirs
- DO NOT run yarn init in either directory - this will break the create-react-app boilerplate
- When ready to run/test, use `yarn dev` when in the ROOT folder - this will concurrently run both the server and the react server (ports 3001, and 3000 respectively).
